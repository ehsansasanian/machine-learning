    "There are two classes, both occurring with probability 0.5. There is one input unit. Only the first sequence element conveys relevant information about the class. Sequence elements at positions $t > 1$ stem from a Gaussian with mean zero and variance 0.2. The first sequence element is 1.0 (-1.0) for class 1 (2). Target at sequence end is 1.0 (0.0) for class 1 (2)\n",

Implement the [Python3 generator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator) pattern and produce data in the way described above. The input sequences should have the shape `(T, 1)` and the target values should have the shape `(1,)`."
